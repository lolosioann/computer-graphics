# Computer Graphics Exercises

This project was developed as part of the course **"Computer Graphics"**, part of the 2024â€“25 syllabus for the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

Each directory corresponds to an individual exercise and can be executed independently by running the respective `demo.py` files. Combined, the exercises form the foundation of a complete 2D graphics rendering pipeline.

# ðŸŸ¦ Exercise 1 - Triangle Rasterizer

This module implements a basic triangle rasterizer from scratch in Python, supporting both **flat shading** and **texture shading**. The renderer takes as input triangle geometry and vertex attributes and outputs shaded images by scanline-filling triangles in image space.

## ðŸ“¸ Output Examples

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center">
  <img src="exercise_1/pics/rendered_img_f.png" width="300"/><br/>
  <strong>Flat shading</strong>
</td>
<td align="center">
  <img src="exercise_1/pics/rendered_img_t.png" width="300"/><br/>
  <strong>Texture shading</strong>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

## ðŸ§  Features

- âœ… Linear interpolation of vertex attributes (position, color, UV)
- âœ… Scanline triangle filling
- âœ… Flat shading (uniform per-triangle color)
- âœ… Texture mapping via interpolated UV coordinates
- âœ… Triangle depth sorting using painterâ€™s algorithm

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Input Data**:
   - `vertices`: 2D vertex positions
   - `vcolors`: RGB colors per vertex (for flat shading)
   - `uv`: texture coordinates (for texture shading)
   - `depth`: z-values per vertex

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Faces are converted to triangle descriptors with vertex data and average depth.
   - Triangles are sorted in back-to-front order.

3. **Rendering**:
   - For each triangle, depending on the selected shading method (`"f"` or `"t"`), a scanline algorithm fills pixels and assigns colors.
   - UV-to-texture-space mapping is applied in texture mode.
